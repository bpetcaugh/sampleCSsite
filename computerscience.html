                        skill set, needed to be successful in upper-level computer science courses. Students will
                        be exposed to various programming languages, and platforms, to be given a broad picture
                        of the discipline. They will familiarize themselves with the logic that a computer takes
                        when executing code, and how that code is run through a device. Throughout the course,
                        students will complete basic projects in the following areas: Web Design, Gaming,
                        Artificial Intelligence, and App Creation. This class meets three times per cycle.</p>

                        Microsoft Office programs, as well as similar open source programs. Database management
                        and design will also be discussed. Students will learn how to write macros for spreadsheets
                        and use a database command language to accomplish tasks. Students will be introduced to
                        basic web page creation techniques and programs. This class meets three periods per cycle. </p>

                        opportunity to learn programming. The course is taught from a liberal arts perspective;
                        therefore, students need only to have studied Algebra I and one year of world language as 
                        9 Holy Ghost Preparatory School Program of Studies
                        prerequisites. Throughout the semester, students are required to write programs to solve
                        problems while learning the Java programming language. This course is especially
                        appropriate for those students interested in learning problem solving skills and logic. This
                        course is not appropriate for those students who “want to learn more about computers.”
                        General knowledge of current Windows operating systems, and the Holy Ghost Prep
                        network environment is required. Enrollment preference is given to upperclassmen.</p>

                        design. It combines the logic of programming, and the art and creativity of design, to help
                        students create interesting and interactive sites. There is also an emphasis on using
                        websites to gather and process information, and how to properly transport that
                        information from a computer to a server. Students will learn the following computer

                        first semester, students in this course will explore various current topics in computer
                        science, and will be led through large-scale programming projects. These topics may
                        include, but are not limited to: database development, software and app creation, artificial
                        intelligence, machine learning, and cyber security. For the second semester, the class will
                        switch to a research-based, student led model. Students will choose a topic to research, and
                        will be guided through the engineering process, in order to create something new. They will
                        then present their findings, and new developments, to their peers and the community</p>
