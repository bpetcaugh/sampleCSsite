# sampleCSsite
Work in progress for the advanced topics class. 

Group Bootstrap Site

# Introduction
This will be a website built for the computer science and engineering department here at HGP. Every student will work on an individual page (and will also contribute to the styles sheet, deptstyle.css â€“ this will ensure consistent design/feel across the site).  Students will then push their work to a GIT repo so that everyone has the same file system. Once the site is progressing, it will be live on the CS server for others to see. This will take about 1-2 weeks of class time total (that includes the work on this page, and then the server work later).

Along with completing the work described below, every student should be adding some other component from the documentation here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/alerts/

# Site Pages

Index.html = This is the main landing page for the site. It should have links to all other pages in some sort of navigation bar somewhere on the page (top or left). It should also have images of teachers in the department, and a carousel of 3-4 images for different projects that have been completed. 

deptstyle.css = This is the main CSS for the page. It should include all styles that will override the bootstrap classes. Because of this, it needs to be linked in the HEAD tag under the link to bootstrap CSS. (one person will work on this, but then all other pages will also need to link to it)

contact.html = This page will have a FORM item, where someone can come to fill out their personal information, along with a request/question/concern, and it will be emailed out to bpetcaugh@holyghostprep.org . 

engineering.html = This page will have CARDS displaying what engineering classes we currently teach at HGP, as well as a picture of the Innovation Lab, and description of the class. It should also have a form that would let you change the description if you wanted to update it (as a teacher).

computerscience.html = This page will have CARDS displaying what computer science classes we currently teach at HGP, as well as a picture of the computer lab, and description of the class. It should also have a form that would let you change the description if you wanted to update it (as a teacher).

vexrobotics.html = This page will display different robotics team lists on a CAROUSEL, with a picture of them and their robot in the background. Beneath the carousel, you should place the information that is posted on the current robotics website (wrapped in containers).

projects.html = This should be a list of projects that have been completed in different classes. You can choose 6 different projects, and include them as CARDS in 2 COLUMNS. There should be a picture or video for each, and a description of the project itself. 

helpfulLinks.html = This site will contain a variety of links to help students who are interested in engineering or computer science topics. There should be a variety of COLUMNS, with descriptions of why the link is helpful, and BUTTONS to the links.
